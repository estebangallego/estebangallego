### 🧱 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about crafting solid backend architectures in **Laravel** and building dynamic, modern interfaces with **Vue.js**.  
I specialize in scalable APIs, clean service layers, full test coverage, and reactive frontends — turning complex business requirements into seamless digital experiences.

---

### 🧩 Full-Stack Capabilities

I love owning the full cycle of development — from planning database schemas and APIs to implementing clean, reactive UIs.

- ✅ **Backend**: Authentication, API's, authorization (Roles/Policies), Eloquent ORM, data integrity
- ✅ **Frontend**: Dynamic dashboards, filters, modals, real-time updates with Vue
- ✅ **API**: RESTful endpoints with Swagger docs, Sanctum-authenticated SPAs
- ✅ **Integration**: Smooth frontend/backend sync using Laravel
- ✅ **Testing**: End-to-end test strategy (unit, feature, edge case, UI logic)

### 🧪 My Approach to Testing

I believe in testable, maintainable code. I regularly:
- Write expressive, isolated PHPUnit
- Optimize test speed and integrate CI Pipelines with GitHub Actions

### ⚙️ My Laravel Toolbox

- **Framework**: Laravel, Vue.js, Jetstream, Livewire, Nova- **Docker / Laravel Sail** for containerized dev
- **DBeaver** for PostgreSQL management
- **Tinkerwell** for Laravel REPL and live prototyping
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Cursor + Zsh + custom aliases (like `sart`)**
- **Laravel Debugbar** for runtime debugging
- **Telescope & Horizon** for queue and request visibility
- **PHPUnit** The real magic!
